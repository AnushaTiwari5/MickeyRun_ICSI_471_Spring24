# MICKEY RUN

A simple jumping game inspired by the Google Offline Dinosaur Game (https://trex-runner.com/).

## Instructions on Running the Game
1. <b>You will need MATLAB App Designer to run the game.</b> 
In the Project Folder, navigate to src -> gameUI.mlapp. 
2. Once App Designer has loaded, click on the "Run" button on the toolbar to launch the game.

### Playing the Game
1. Use the Start Game button to begin the game. The game will end either on a collision, or when the End Game button is pressed.
2. Use the Keyboard Space bar or Left Mouse Click to make Mickey jump up. 
3. The goal of the game is to have Mickey jump and avoid as many obstacles as possible. 
Obstacles will appear on the right edge of the screen and move left towards Mickey.
4. Each successful jump from Mickey will increase your score by 1 (visible on the top left corner of the game window).
5. As your score increases, the difficulty of the game will increase by a rise in the speed or number of the obstacles. 
Do your best to get a high score, and have fun!
